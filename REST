= Heroku REST API

You can use the Heroku class provided by the RubyGem to call the API.  The docs
below are provided for the rare circumstance where you may wish to access the
REST resources directly.

== Authentication

Use basic HTTP authentication to provide the Heroku username (email) and
password with each request.

== Resources & Actions

  GET http://heroku.com/apps

Returns XML listing of apps belonging to the user.

  POST http://heroku.com/apps

Create a new app with an untitled name.  XML of app, including the generated
name, is returned.

  POST http://heroku.com/apps?app[name]=<i>appname</i>

Create a new app with the provided name.

  DELETE http://heroku.com/apps/<i>appname</i>

Permanently destroy the app.

  PUT http://heroku.com/user/authkey

Upload an ssh public key.  The payload of the PUT should be the plain text ssh
key, i.e. the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.  Each subsequent call overwrites
the previous key.

== Example

  require 'net/http'
  Net::HTTP.start('heroku.com') do |http|
    request = Net::HTTP.Post.new('/apps')
    request.basic_auth 'me@example.com', 'mypass'
    res = http.request(request)
    puts res.body
  end
